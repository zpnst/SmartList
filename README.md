# SmartList

## Structure
  The list is developed on the basis of a template class, which is based on a doubly linked list

## std::shared_ptr<Type> & std::weak_ptr<Type>

  Using std::weak_ptr<Type> as a pointer to the previous element of a node, 
  together with std::shared_ptr<Type> helped to avoid cyclic references

## Different types of constructors are implemented
