# SmartList

## Structure
  The list is developed on the basis of a template class, which is based on a doubly linked list

## std::shared_ptr<Type> & std::weak_ptr<Type>

  Using std::weak_ptr<Type> as a pointer to the previous element of a node, 
  together with std::shared_ptr<Type> helped to avoid cyclic references

## Different types of constructors are implemented

## Functions for working with a list
  1) Function for adding an item to any place in the list
  2) Function for deleting an item anywhere in the list
  3) Function for creating a set from a list
  4) Function for sorting the list based on bubble sort
  5) Operator [] overload
  6) Function for formatted list output

## And functions for convenience:

## Operators overloading
  Overload has been implemented for *, +, / operators
  They are responsible for operations between 
  a List and a Variable and a List and a List
