# SmartList

# Structure
The list is designed based on the template class List. 
It is based on a doubly linked list.

# std::shared_ptr<Type> & std::weak_ptr<Type>

using std::weak_ptr<Type> as a pointer to the previous element of a node, 
together with std::shared_ptr<Type> helped to avoid cyclic references

# Different types of constructors are implemented

# Functions for working with a list
  1) Function for adding an item to any place in the list
  2) Function for deleting an item anywhere in the list
  3) Function for creating a set from a list
  4) Function for sorting the list based on bubble sort
  5) Operator [] overload
  6) Function for formatted list output

And functions for convenience:
